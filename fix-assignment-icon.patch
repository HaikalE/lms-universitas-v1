# Fix for Assignment Icon Import Error

## Problem
The error occurs because `Assignment` is not a valid icon in lucide-react library.

## Solution
Replace any import of `Assignment` from lucide-react with one of these valid alternatives:

### Option 1: FileText (Recommended)
```typescript
// Instead of:
import { Assignment as AssignmentIcon } from 'lucide-react';

// Use:
import { FileText as AssignmentIcon } from 'lucide-react';
```

### Option 2: ClipboardList
```typescript
import { ClipboardList as AssignmentIcon } from 'lucide-react';
```

### Option 3: NotepadText
```typescript
import { NotepadText as AssignmentIcon } from 'lucide-react';
```

## Files to Check
Look for the problematic import in these likely locations:
- frontend/src/pages/assignments/
- frontend/src/components/
- Any file that imports from 'lucide-react'

## Search Command
Run this in your project root to find the problematic import:
```bash
grep -r "Assignment.*lucide-react" frontend/src/
```

## Common Valid Icons for Assignments
- FileText: For general assignments
- ClipboardList: For assignment lists
