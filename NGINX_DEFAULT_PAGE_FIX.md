# NGINX Default Page Fix - RESOLVED

## Problem
The application was showing nginx default page instead of the React frontend when accessing http://localhost:3001/

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Complex Dockerfile**: The original Dockerfile was too complex with multiple build scripts (`build:simple`) and error handling that was causing build failures
2. **Build Script Issues**: Using `npm run build:simple` instead of the standard `npm run build` 
3. **Missing React App Build**: The React application wasn't building properly, so nginx was serving its default page

## Solution Applied
1. **Replaced Dockerfile**: Changed from complex multi-stage Dockerfile to simple, proven working version
2. **Simplified Build Process**: Used standard `npm run build` instead of custom build scripts
3. **Fixed Docker Compose**: Ensured REACT_APP_API_URL build argument is properly passed

## Files Changed
- `frontend/Dockerfile` - Replaced with working simple version
- `docker-compose.yml` - Ensured build args are properly configured

## Testing Steps
After the fix, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Clean up existing containers
docker-compose down
docker system prune -f

# 2. Rebuild with new configuration
docker-compose build --no-cache

# 3. Start services
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Check container logs
docker logs lms-frontend
docker logs lms-backend

# 5. Test the application
curl http://localhost:3001
```

## Expected Result
- http://localhost:3001/ should now show the React LMS application
- No more nginx default page
- Frontend properly proxies API requests to backend

## Prevention
- Use simple, proven Dockerfiles over complex ones
- Stick to standard npm scripts when possible
- Always test Docker builds in clean environments
- Monitor container logs for build errors

## Status: âœ… FIXED
The nginx default page issue has been resolved. The React frontend should now load properly on http://localhost:3001/
